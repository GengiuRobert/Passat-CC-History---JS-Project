                <source src="/passat cc history/audio/volkswagen_german_pronunciation.mp3">
            </audio>) is a German automobile manufacturer headquartered in
            Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany.
            Founded in 1937 by the German Labour Front under the Nazi Party and revived into the global brand it is
            known as today post-World War II by the British Army officer Ivan Hirst,
            it is known for the iconic Beetle and serves as the flagship brand of the Volkswagen Group,
            the largest automotive manufacturer by worldwide sales in 2016 and 2017.
            The group's biggest market is China (including Hong Kong and Macau),
            which delivers 40 percent of its sales and profits. Its name is derived from the German-language terms Volk
            and Wagen, translating to "people's car" when combined.</p>

        <h3 class="h3ofC2">The Birth of the Volkswagen Passat CC: A New Era of Comfort and Style</h3>
        <p id="pofC2">The Volkswagen CC, originally marketed as the Volkswagen Passat CC in its first generation, is a
            variant of
            the Volkswagen Passat that trades headroom and cargo space for a coupé-like profile and sweeping roofline.
            The CC debuted in January 2008, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit and was
            discontinued after the 2017 model year.
            Volkswagen said the name CC stands for Comfort Coupe, recognizing its combination of a coupe-like profile
            with four rather than two doors.
            While based on the Passat, and sharing its wheelbase, the CC is 27 mm (1.06 inches) longer, 50 mm (1.97
            inches) lower, and 36 mm (1.42 inches) wider than the Passat.While the CC has been replaced by the Arteon in
            most markets,
            the latter vehicle retains the CC nameplate in China.</p>

        <h3 class="h3ofC3">Market Launch</h3>
        <p id="pofC3">At its launch in 2008, Volkswagen forecast 300,000 sales over a period of seven years.
            The automaker expected that 60% of these sales (about 26,000 units per year) will come from the market of
            the United States.
            In China, the CC was released by FAW-Volkswagen on July 15, 2010, and was available in 1.8TSI and 2.0TSI
            trims.
            Compared to other midsize sedans in the marketplace, the 2013 Volkswagen CC was evaluated by Edmunds as
            "attractive and higher quality alternative ... though its smallish backseat and trunk may be deal-breakers
            ... [and] the sport tuned suspension is on the firm side."
            Automotive journalists describe the CC sedan's ride as "nearly sports car firm, with every bump and
            undulation sent directly to your backside."</p>

        <h3 class="h3ofC4">Specifications</h3>
        <p id="pofC4">The car has a 2,710 mm (106.7 in) wheelbase and was available with a 1.4 L E85 TFSI (Finland and
            Sweden), 1.8
            L petrol inline-four, 2.0 L petrol inline four, a 2.0 L inline four TDI engine in various drivetrain
            configurations, as well as with a 3.6 L VR6 engine producing 220 kW (299 PS; 295 hp) with 4motion four-wheel
            drive and a six speed Direct-Shift Gearbox transmission.
            The North American market had the 2.0T I4 and 3.6 L VR6 engine as options. This version of the VR6 engine
            produced 206 kW (276 hp) and 265 lb⋅ft (359 N⋅m) of torque in both front wheel drive and 4MOTION versions,
            while the 2.0T produced 200 hp (149 kW) and 207 lb⋅ft (281 N⋅m). Manual transmission was available in the
            2.0T engine option only. It also came with automatic transmission.
            On the European market, the CC was offered with 4MOTION four-wheel-drive on the 2.0 L TDI engines. The 103
            kW (140 PS) model came with manual transmission and the 125 kW (170 PS) model with Direct-Shift Gearbox
            (DSG). An AdBlue version offering 105 kW (143 PS) named BlueTDI was also produced. Availability varied by
            national markets.
            For the 2011 model year, the 2.0T in Europe was upgraded to 155 kW (211 PS; 208 hp) by using the engine
            variant introduced in the Golf VI GTI.</p>

        <p class="pofC5">A facelift to the CC was presented at the LA Auto Show, and production started in January 2012.
            The front and rear were revised to make the CC look similar to the then current Volkswagen design, while the
            midsection was unchanged. Interior changes included a minor updates to the center console along with an
            updated ACC control panel. This design was also used in the Passat Alltrack.</p>

        <p class="pofC5">European engine options remain the same as for the 2011 Passat CC. Transmission options were
            carried over from the previous version, but the diesel automatic transmission now has with a free wheel
            function that is claimed to reduce fuel consumption by disengaging the clutch, when the driver lifts their
            foot from the accelerator.

            The XDS electronic differential brake that was also used in the Golf GTI was available on the CC as standard
            or optional equipment. Initially available only in V6 as an AWD alternative, but diesel versions became
            available during 2012. Availability of diesel 4WD varied by market.

            In January 2013, the optional 2.0 TDI 170 PS (125 kW; 168 hp) was replaced by an uprated version with 177 PS
            (130 kW; 175 hp). The torque increased from 350 to 380 N⋅m (258 to 280 lbf⋅ft). In 2015, this was again
            uprated to 184 PS (135 kW; 181 hp), this time from the new EA288 engine complying with the Euro 6 emissions
            standard that replaced the previous EA189. Maximum torque remained at 380 N⋅m (280 lbf⋅ft). The 140 PS (103
            kW; 138 hp) was uprated to 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp).</p>
